Day 1: Setting up the Basic Structure
Initialize the Project: Create a basic project structure with directories for code and documentation.
Input Mechanism: Implement a way to accept user input for expenses (e.g., using input() for amount and description).
Data Storage: Use a list or a dictionary to store the expenses temporarily for now.

Day 2: Categorization and Data Handling
Expense Categories: Add functionality for users to categorize their expenses (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
Data Storage Enhancement: Store expenses in a structured format (e.g., using dictionaries with the keys: amount, description, category).

Day 3: Implementing Data Persistence
File Storage: Learn how to write and read expense data from a file (e.g., using CSV or JSON format).

Day 4: Summarizing Data
Expense Summaries: Write a function to provide monthly summaries and category-wise expenditures. You can filter expenses by date or category.

Day 5: Error Handling
User Input Validation: Implement error handling to manage non-numeric input for expenses or incorrect category choices.

Day 6: User Interface (UI)
Text-based UI: Develop a simple menu-driven interface for users to interact with the tracker (e.g., add expenses, view summaries, etc.).

Day 7: Documentation and Final Testing
Code Documentation: Add comments and documentation explaining key functions.
Final Testing: Test the application for bugs and ensure it works smoothly.
